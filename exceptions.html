          If temporary memory resources are required by the algorithm and none are available,
          the algorithm throws a `std::bad_alloc` exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the execution of a standard parallel algorithm, if the application of a function
          object terminates with an uncaught exception, the behavior of the program is determined
          by the type of execution policy used to invoke the algorithm:

          <ul>
            <li>
              If the execution policy object is of type <code>vector_execution_policy</code>,
              <code>std::terminate</code> shall be called.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the execution policy object is of type <code>sequential_execution_policy</code> or
              <code>parallel_execution_policy</code>, the execution of the algorithm terminates with an
              <code>exception_list</code> exception. All uncaught exceptions thrown during
              the application of user-provided function objects shall be contained in the
              <code>exception_list</code>.

              <cxx-note>
                For example, the number of invocations of the user-provided function object in
                <code>for_each</code> is unspecified. When <code>for_each</code> is executed sequentially,
                only one exception will be contained in the <code>exception_list</code> object.
              </cxx-note>

              <cxx-note>
                These guarantees imply that, unless the algorithm has failed to allocate memory and
                terminated with <code>std::bad_alloc</code>, all exceptions thrown during the execution of
                the algorithm are communicated to the caller. It is unspecified whether an algorithm implementation will "forge ahead" after 
                encountering and capturing a user exception.
              </cxx-note>

              <cxx-note>
                The algorithm may terminate with the <code>std::bad_alloc</code> exception even if one or more
                user-provided function objects have terminated with an exception. For example, this can happen when an algorithm fails to allocate memory while
                creating or adding elements to the <code>exception_list</code> object.
              </cxx-note>
            </li>

            <li>
              If the execution policy object is of any other type, the behavior is implementation-defined.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
